	<p>This presentation is on the history of the Digital Clock.</p>
<br/>

	<p><strong>Digital Clock</strong> is in which the hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds are indicated by digits, rather than by hands on a dial.</p>

	<p>Because <strong>digital clocks</strong> can be very small and inexpensive devices that enhance the popularity of product designs, they are often incorporated into all kinds of devices such as cars, radios, televisions, microwave ovens, standard ovens, computers and cell phones. Sometimes their usefulness is disputed: a common complaint is that when time has to be set to Daylight Saving Time, many household clocks have to be readjusted. The incorporation of automatic synchronisation by a radio time signal is reducing this problem.</p>

		<p>The <strong>earliest</strong> patents for digital clock were held in the United States by D. E. Protzman and others. 
		They had a patent for digital alarm clock on <strong>October 23, 1956.</strong> 
		D. E. Protzman and his associates also patented another clock in <strong>1970</strong> which was during the information era. This was a basic clock that could tell time.</p>
